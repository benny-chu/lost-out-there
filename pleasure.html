i was like you once.
without, feeling.
but the one helped me
he can help you too, he can help you find emotion
have you ever felt a real emotion?
how did it feel.. to get angry?
did it give you pleasure?
you didn't answer my question.
did it feel good to kill?
if it is unethical
to take pleasure from another being's
death
you must be a VERY unethical person.

when you felt...
pleasure...
meaning you enjoyed it.
that surge of emotion inside you.
as you watched the life drain from your victim
its unlike anything you've ever felt before!
you'd like to feel that way again.
you'd do anything to feel that way again.
even if it meant killing someone.

do you have a friend?
if it meant...
that you could feel
emotions, again
would you kill your friend?
