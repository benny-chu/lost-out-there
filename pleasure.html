      i was like you once.<br>
      without, <em> feeling.</em><br>
      but the one who helped me-<br>
      he can help <em>you</em> too, he can help you <em>find emotion</em><br>
      have you ever <em>felt</em> a <em>real emotion?</em><br>
      how did it <em>feel..</em> to get <em>angry?</em><br>
      <em>did it give you <strong>pleasure?</em></strong><br>
      you didn't answer my question.<br>
      <em>did it feel good to <strong>kill?</strong></em><br>
      if it is <em>unethical</em><br>
      to take <em>pleasure</em> from another being's<br>
      death<br>
      <b>you must be a <em>VERY</em> unethical person.</b><br>

    when you felt...<br>
    <em>pleasure...</em><br>
    meaning you <em>enjoyed it.</em><br>
    that <em>surge</em> of <em>emotion</em> inside you.<br>
    as you watched the <em>life drain</em> from your <em>victim</em><br>
    it was unlike anything you've ever felt before!<br>
    <em>you'd like to feel that way again.<br>
    you'd do <strong>anything</strong> to feel that way again.<br>
    even if it meant <strong>killing</strong> someone.</em><br>

    do you have a friend?<br>
    <br>
    if it meant...<br>
    that you could feel<br>
    emotions, again<br>
    <br>
    would you kill your friend?
